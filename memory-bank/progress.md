## Known Issues

### Hardware
- The SEN55 sensor requires a 3-second warm-up period before readings stabilize
- Temperature readings may be affected by the ESP32's self-heating
- Continuous operation of the SEN55's fan increases power consumption

### Software
- Memory usage increases over time, requiring periodic garbage collection
- Web server performance may degrade with multiple simultaneous connections
- CSV file operations can cause brief processing delays
- No data validation currently implemented for sensor readings

### User Experience
- Web interface lacks visual indicators for good/poor air quality
- No alerts for threshold violations
- Limited data analysis capabilities in the current interface

## Evolution of Project Decisions

### Initial Concept to Current Implementation

1. **Initial Concept** (Starting Point)
   - Basic environmental monitoring with ESP32 and SEN55
   - Simple data display on TFT screen
   - No data storage or web interface

2. **First Iteration** (Foundation)
   - Established communication with SEN55 sensor
   - Implemented basic TFT display
   - Added WiFi connectivity
   - Created simple web server

3. **Second Iteration** (Data Management)
   - Added in-memory data structures
   - Implemented CSV storage
   - Created data persistence across reboots
   - Established 5-minute reading interval

4. **Third Iteration** (Web Interface)
   - Developed responsive HTML/CSS layout
   - Added current readings display
   - Implemented basic charting
   - Created auto-refresh functionality

5. **Current Implementation** (Enhanced Features)
   - Added date range selection
   - Implemented advanced charting
   - Added connection status indicator
   - Optimized memory management
   - Improved error handling

### Key Decision Points

#### Data Storage Approach
- **Decision**: Use CSV file format with in-memory deque structures
- **Alternatives Considered**: 
  - SQLite database (rejected due to complexity on CircuitPython)
  - JSON storage (rejected due to parsing overhead)
  - Binary format (rejected due to reduced human readability)
- **Rationale**: CSV provides a good balance of simplicity, human readability, and parsing efficiency

#### Sensor Reading Frequency
- **Decision**: 5-minute intervals
- **Alternatives Considered**:
  - 1-minute intervals (rejected due to storage and power concerns)
  - 10-minute intervals (rejected as too infrequent for meaningful trends)
  - Variable intervals (rejected due to implementation complexity)
- **Rationale**: 5-minute intervals provide sufficient granularity while managing storage and power constraints

#### Web Interface Technology
- **Decision**: Client-side rendering with Chart.js
- **Alternatives Considered**:
  - Server-side generated charts (rejected due to ESP32 processing limitations)
  - Simpler non-interactive charts (rejected due to reduced user experience)
  - WebSockets for real-time updates (rejected due to implementation complexity)
- **Rationale**: Client-side rendering offloads processing to the user's device while providing rich visualization
